# Filter Particles
Notebooks in this directory are used to filter particles by some statistic.
In almost all cases, [Subset Particles by Statistic](https://guide.cryosparc.com/processing-data/all-job-types-in-cryosparc/particle-curation/job-subset-particles-by-statistic) will perform better and should be preferred.
